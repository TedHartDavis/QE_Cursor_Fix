# QE Cursor Fix
## Inspired by Joshua Ashton

## What?
Cursor acceleration ("enhance pointer precision") is bad.
It needs to be disabled. Also, the mouse sensitivity can be massively 
increased while remaining usable.

## Mmmkay, so how do I do this?

1. Open 'Run' - press `WINDOWS KEY` and `R` together at the same time.
2. Type `main.cpl` into the 'Run' dialog.
3. Press the `ENTER` key on your keyboard.
4. Go to `Pointer Options`. This can be done by pressing `TAB` a few 
times and hitting enter, or you can move your mouse and click.
5. `UNCHECK` the `Enhance pointer precision` tickbox.
6. --Optional-- `CLICK AND DRAG` the `Select a pointer speed:` slider to 
suit your preference.

### And you're done!
